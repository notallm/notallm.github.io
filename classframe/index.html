        MIT promotes its student body to collaborate on assigments. Why? Because collaboration produces the best work. 3 minds are better than 1.
        <br><br>
        ClassFrame allows students across its network to join classrooms, ask questions, and get answers, all in one platform. 
        <br><br>
        And it's not just that, Classframe is:
    </p>
<center><h3>For students, by students</h3></center>
<p class = "lead">
    They say we should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. ClassFrame's team has walked way more than a mile, and we still have
    a whole lot of miles left. Who understands what students need better than other students?
</p>
<center><h3>Professional</h3></center>
<p class = "lead">
    All users on the ClassFrame network are linked to their school, making sure everything is true and professional. We don't want trolls on our platform, 
    and neither do you. When it's T-5 before the assignment is due, all you want is the truth, and ClassFrame is here for you when that happens.
</p>
<center><h3>Fast</h3></center>
<p class = "lead">
    Ever try to use any software given by the school? They're clunky, hard-to-use and simply inefficient. ClassFrame offers a clean and ad-free experience,
    because we know you don't want to click through 3 popups to get to what you want.
