This is an escape from my usual stream of posts, for I wanted to attempt to expand the horizons of my routine writing.

Sam Altman is a polarizing figure in Silicon Valley, being the co-founder of Loopt, ex-president of Y Combinator, ex-CEO of Reddit, and current CEO of OpenAI. Therefore, it is trivial to assume that he is a revered person in the startup space.

This post is based upon the one by Altman, titled [“How To Be Successful,”](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) a title that drives views, which details 13 points to note to achieve what he calls “outlier success.” He notes that his points are geared toward founders but can be applied to anyone — my takeaways are for the former, and success in this sense relates to startups and startup success. I’ve often wondered what it takes to be a founder, much less a successful one. There’s a certain elusiveness to the idea of success itself, for it rests nearly entirely upon what you constitute as succeeding. As Altman details, most startup founders begin with the prospect of riches but ultimately desire importance and impact. However, since it is imperative we define the parameters from which to judge success, we will consider impact. The following sections analyze Altman’s points and explain how the average person can attempt to implement these into their life.

**1. Compound yourself**

Altman begins with the notion of being exponential rather than linear. Of course, that is what we desire, to greatly improve year-over-year. He details that we, in careers, should be compounding in relativity to effectiveness. Essentially, one with two years of industry experience should not be as effective as those with twenty; however, it seems rather apparent that it is increasingly becoming the case. The root of the problem appears to lie in the rate of learning. A general example is those working in the software engineering space: most engineers learn and stick to the frameworks, tools, languages, and technologies learned during their undergrad or early career. There is no exponential growth here — it is barely linear, for knowledge in one niche domain can only grow so much. This results in more curious and passionate developers being able to compete with minimal experience. Simply put, the value for a unit of work should increase in value and output as time passes and experience grows. Current work should be done in the hopes of reducing previous work to a footnote.

**2. Have almost too much self-belief**

Self-belief is a powerful and interesting concept and something
that I have personal experience dealing with. For as long as I can remember, I have had a sense of imposter syndrome where my mind undermines myself, and one voice often does not agree. Looping back to the notion at hand, it is imperative that we all instill a sense of self-belief. Confidence in our contrarian ideas allows them to flourish and become popular. However, as Altman notes, it is also vital not to confuse self-belief with self-awareness. Respond to criticism well and be in touch with the situation.

**3. Learn to think independently**

Traditional schooling does not cultivate this, but it is a crucial part 
of being successful. Altman notes that the easiest way to develop this is by thinking from first principles, generating ideas from there, and exchanging them to grow understanding and create an iterative process to hone this skill. As common belief teaches us, the best ideas do come from a problem we have; however, creative ideas come from creating solutions in a vacuum of no solutions to solve a problem that seems impossible.

**4. Get good at sales**

Sales are the next step after self-belief. Selling yourself and your 
idea gets both to the next level of success. Altman describes this as the combination of vision, communication, charisma, and ability to execute. Similarly, his Stanford course on startups discussed this, and many VCs look at these traits when deciding. Vision is the idea at hand, communication allows the idea to be passed around and grown, charisma is what makes others have the desire to listen to the idea, and ability of execution is the 
metric that gives evidence of whether the idea can be brought to life.

**5. Make it easy to take risks**

In the startup world, taking risks is relatively commonplace. Risks 
allow you to escape the mentality of perfection and make perfect decisions. Altman also brings up a good point: risks are easier to take early and when basics are met. Early in our careers, we do not have much to lose, and once basic obligations are met, like a house and enough financial padding to make mistakes, risks are made easier to take. Risks are great when the loss is 1x, but the win is 100x, and advancing in that space allows for compounding growth. However, Altman also notes that founders who have spent chunks of their careers working at big tech companies like Google or Meta become fixated on that lifestyle, and growth past that stage becomes increasingly difficult the most time passes.

**6. Focus**

Focus is a great tool to master. Beyond the ability to focus, it is vital 
to have the skill of being able to determine what to focus on. Altman notes that spending time to decide what to focus on is crucial. Once that is determined, the Meta, or rather Facebook, philosophy of “move fast and break things” should be adopted, achieving small tasks to build up onto the bigger problem to be solved.

**7. Work hard**

Although embedded in the American Dream, working hard is still crucial to growth. Although working smarter is indeed more crucial, getting to the top 1% requires both. It is imperative to understand the work is somewhat correlated with the results gained. In some cases, entirely linear, as studying and reading yield benefits if, and only if, the time and work are put in. A well-recited story is that of Elon Musk, who, to this day, only sleeps 5 hours a day and continues to spend hours at work managing all his different ventures. Early Musk spent nights at offices too, and he continues to do this to this day. However, it is vital to understand how to work hard without burnout. Altman also details that one should work hard at the start, which allows it to compound and grow like interest, with time passing growing, the benefits to reap.

**8. Be bold**

Essentially, be ambitious and work on a problem that drives you 
and those around you. Despite the fact that curiosity killed the cat, it also led to many of the top startups. Be curious, and do not second guess intrinsic motivations.

**9. Be willful**

People have the capability to create meaningful results. However, 
drag forces like self-doubt and giving up impedes what could happen. Being willful means wanting more and having an internal drive to go towards it. A great example is asking for what you want, which might not always work, but like point 5, the loss is low, but the gains are huge. Altman relates this to Airbnb, which had will drive it through tough times.

**10. Be hard to compete with**

This is common knowledge in big tech and even startups — being 
hard to compete with creates a sense of value. Not in the sense of monopolizing the market, but creating a business that is so well designed and offers so much that it becomes greatly difficult to compete. Altman also notes the pitfalls of going with the flock and mimicking group emotions and notions. Competing with a concept everyone has is simple, but it is difficult to compete with something different.

**11. Build a network**

Networking is the cornerstone of great teamwork, a crucial part of which is 
having a team. Altman describes that the easiest way to build a network is to help others as much as possible. Over a long period of time, it can yield wonderful results. He also notes that generosity towards those working with you can generate a similar impact. A perplexing stage of building a network is finding a group of people that suit you. This comes by defining yourself with your strengths and acknowledging weaknesses, which allows you to find compatible people, filling in the weaknesses to create great group strength.

**12. You get rich by owning things**

Altman describes a misconception that I relate to equally: the notion that 
becoming wealthy is based on salaries. However, that is far from the truth: those who own assets that gain value get rich. Nobody gets on Forbes with income, but by owning something, entirely or fractionally, that generates value. This can be a business, real estate, or intellectual property. Altman also has an interesting concept that time scales linearly but assets exponentially, where a salary rewards time put in, while assets reward time and the asset itself.

**13. Be internally driven**

Essentially, have an intrinsic motivation drive you, not external factors like 
impressing others, while Altman describes two pitfalls. First, it causes people to work on consensus notions, not interesting and new ideas. Common ideas lose the competitive edge and are new to the market. Second, risk calculations will be skewed to low, for all actions will be to keep up, not to advance.
