            MemorAI is the next generation of learning. <br><br>Like Quizlet, it is a flashcard website, but 
            the similarities end there. <br><br>MemorAI generates questions for <span class = "hook_special">YOUR</span>
            sets, based on <span class = "hook_special">what YOU need</span>.<br><br> On TOP of that, it 
            <span class = "hook_special">TELLS</span> you WHAT to study and WHEN, using spaced repetition, a
            system <span class = "hook_special">DESIGNED</span> to help you memorize and learn.
