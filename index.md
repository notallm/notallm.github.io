I am a student at Irvington High School (Class of 2026), interested in A(G)I, alignment, and high-performant computing.

I am currently developing [ClassFrame](https://classfra.me), as well as doing research
on transformer-based systems with [Dr. Phil Mui](https://sites.google.com/asdrp.org/mui/who).

I previously had a summer apprenticeship at [Google](https://google.com), where I learned engineering and product
management from the Corporate Engineering team, and first began development for ClassFrame, and presented it to 
industry professionals.

Every summer, I run [NXT AI](https://nxtaicamp.com), an online nonprofit AI camp for talented youth, where I manage operations,
marketing, sponsorships, and mentor cohorts.

I previously ran [MemorAI](https://memorai.aarushgupta.com), where I started and scaled it to ~170 users from Irvington and ~140
others globally.

In my free time, I also develop open-source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/notallm).
