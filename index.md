I am a student at Irvington High School (Class of 2026), interested in A(G)I, alignment, and high-performant computing.

I am currently leading a team of 5 to develop [ClassFrame](https://classfra.me), as well as doing research
on transformer-based systems with [Dr. Phil Mui](https://sites.google.com/asdrp.org/mui/who).

I am nearing the end of my summer apprenticeship at [Google](https://google.com), where I learned engineering and product
management from the Corprate Engineering team, and first began development for ClassFrame.

Every summer, I run [NXT AI](https://nxtaicamp.com), an online nonprofit AI camp for talented youth, where I manage operations,
marketing, sponserships, and mentor cohorts.

I previously ran [MemorAI](https://memorai.aarushgupta.com), where I started and scaled it to ~170 users from Irvington and ~140
others globally.

In my free time, I also develop open-source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/notallm).
